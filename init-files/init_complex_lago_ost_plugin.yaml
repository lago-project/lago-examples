# This examples requires the 'lago-ost-plugin' installed
# from https://github.com/lago-project/lago-ost-plugin
# and is used by the 'oVirt system tests' project:
# https://ovirt-system-tests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
#
# Few things to note:
# 1. Usage of different vm-types, which lago-ost-plugin provides.
# 2. Using deploy scripts to setup the environment
# 3. Using several NICs from the same network, which
#    are later used to create bonding.
# 4. Some YAML magic to shorten the file.
